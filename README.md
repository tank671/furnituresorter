# furnituresorter

Automatic organization of furniture pictures, using deep learning -- now updated!

The `furnituresorter` folder contains all the files for the latest version of the project, which can be used as a Windows-based desktop app.  To use the application, choose a folder you want sorted and a destination for the sorted pictures.  (Images are copied, not moved.)


The `old` folder contains everything from the previous version, which is still online at classy-railing.now.sh
